    question: "What is the relationship between JavaScript and Java?",
    answer:
      "JavaScript and Java are distinct languages with different use cases, syntax, and execution environments, despite the similar names.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What does it mean for functions to be first-class citizens in JavaScript?",
    answer:
      "In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned from functions.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does JavaScript handle asynchronous operations?",
    answer:
      "JavaScript supports asynchronous operations through callbacks, promises, and the async/await syntax, allowing non-blocking operations.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is dynamic typing in JavaScript?",
    answer:
      "JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare variable types. Variables can hold any type of data and can change types during execution.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a closure in JavaScript?",
    answer:
      "A closure is a function that retains access to its lexical scope, even when the function is executed outside that scope. This allows for powerful patterns like data encapsulation and function factories.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does it mean that JavaScript is event-driven?",
    answer:
      "JavaScript, especially in the context of web development, is event-driven. It listens for and reacts to events like user actions, server responses, and timer expirations.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does prototype-based inheritance work in JavaScript?",
    answer:
      "JavaScript uses prototype-based inheritance rather than classical inheritance. Objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects through prototypes.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is ECMAScript in relation to JavaScript?",
    answer:
      "JavaScript is standardized by ECMAScript (ES). Major updates (ES5, ES6/ES2015, etc.) have introduced new features and syntax improvements.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is hoisting in JavaScript?",
    answer:
      "JavaScript hoists variable and function declarations to the top of their containing scope during compilation. This means you can use functions and variables before their declarations in the code.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is strict mode in JavaScript?",
    answer:
      "Enabling strict mode ('use strict';) in JavaScript changes the way some aspects of the language work, making it easier to write secure and robust code by catching common coding mistakes.",
  },
